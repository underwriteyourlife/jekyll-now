preview: We all make mistakes... right?
---

So in case it isn't clear from my other posts, the majority of the time I have no clue what I am doing in the kitchen. Yes, I can google recipes, tweak them to include my favorite foods (like onions, is it clear that I love onions yet?), and then cut out the expensive ingredients so that my poor, money-starved, wallet can afford to eat it all week. However, that's not the same thing as being a chef, or even just a qualified home-cook. 

Despite my attempts to the contrary, I consistently fail at making recipes that I set my mind on making. Instead of sweeping them under the rug (or right into the trash bin), I figured I would go ahead and post about them so people out there don't make the same mistakes as me... or so people out there can just laugh at the complete mess I can be in the kitchen.

Either or.
