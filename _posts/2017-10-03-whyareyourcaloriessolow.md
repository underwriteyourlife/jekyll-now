A question that a lot of people, specifically off of Reddit where I post photos of my weekly meal preps, ask is "why are your calories so low?". Its a good question! For most people 1300ish kcal/day is not nearly enough to maintain their weight. 

I appreciate the support I get from people who clarify that different people have different needs. As a 130 pound woman, I do not need as many calories as my 210 pound boyfriend. However, I do realize that this number is lower than what I need to maintain my weight. But don't worry! I do eat stuff other than what I meal prep, and its for that reason in particular that I choose to meal prep lower-calorie dishes. 

I am a constant snacker. I love to drink coffee with milk and sugar in the morning, treat myself to a hot chocolate in the afternoon, and lick a fudge pop or two at night (I have an insatiable sweet tooth!). Because I do eat these additional items, plus a few glasses of wine over the weekend, I meal prep lower calorie foods so that my weekly intake is closer to 1600-1700 per day. 

This may still be too low for many people, however, I have found that this amount of calories is sort of my "sweet spot" for maintaining my weight (probably due to the fact that any time I go to a party or a coworker brings bagels and doughnuts into the office I eat way more than my fair share!)

I hope this helps clarify why my meals may seem unhealthily low in calories! If there's a lot of demand to see higher-calorie meal preps, I am more than willing to start cooking them! I don't mind putting on a few pounds if it means I get to cook and eat delicious and frugal meals doing it!
