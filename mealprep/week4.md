title: Week 4 Meal Prep
---

So for week 4 I decided to stir up a few new dishes that I am very excited to dig into!
I will be posting about how each of them held out throughout the week this weekend (including photos!) so be sure to check back. 

First, I decided to stew some coconut curry lentils with cilantro white rice for dinner LINK. While that was cooking, I whipped up some chicken curry salad for lunch LINK, then finished with some seasonal pumpkin-spiced bread rolls LINK. I claim the bread rolls are for breakfast, but I definitely can't resist eating a few of them after dinner as well. They are delicious!
